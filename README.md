# Makefile

Welcome to the Understanding Makefiles repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to learning and mastering Makefiles, an essential tool for automating build processes in software development.

# What are Makefiles?
Makefiles are text files containing directives for automating the building of software projects. They specify how to compile and link code, manage dependencies, and execute tasks efficiently.

Using `make` in combination with a `Makefile` streamlines the compilation and linking of programs, regardless of their sizeâ€”whether small, medium, or large. For example, if you've previously compiled a program using a command like:


`gcc main.c -o main ./main`


or perhaps


`clang main.c -o main ./main`


> The utility of `make` extends beyond mere efficiency. It not only facilitates the creation of shortcuts for routine commands but also serves as a means to eliminate unnecessary clutter within your project. Additionally, its capability to selectively recompile essential parts becomes notably advantageous in colossal codebases, where recompiling only what's needed saves significant time and resources.
